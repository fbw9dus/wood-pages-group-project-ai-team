                Sotwood is usually woods from gymnosperm trees such as pines and spruces. Softwoods 
                <br>
                are not necessarily softer than hardwods.[1] In both groups there is an enormous
                <br>
                variation in actual wood hardness, the range of density in hardwoods completely
                <br>
                including that of softwoods. Some hardwoods (e.g. balsa) are softer than most
                <br>
                softwoods, while the hardest hardwoods are much harder than any sofwood. The woods
                <br>
                of longleaf pine, Douglas fir, and yew are much harder in the mechanical sense than
                <br>
                 several hardwoods.
